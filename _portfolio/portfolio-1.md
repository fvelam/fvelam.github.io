This project aims to develop a full credit-scoring machine-learning solution following the CRISP-ML(Q) framework, including data exploration and quality assessment (univariate EDA, outlier detection, missing-value treatment), feature engineering (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler, ratio feature, dummy encoding), sampling and class balancing (SMOTE/SMOTENC), multivariate feature-reduction techniques (PCA, RFE), training of multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, AdaBoost, etc.), cross-validation (10-fold), hyperparameter tuning (Bayesian Optimization), and interpretation of variable importance to identify the most effective model for predicting credit default.
